# Food Name
# Make sure you're using the latest material names in the list.
# Use these names in the list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# However there is a special pattern that'll still recognize foods if you don't exactly follow the list above.
# Note that some 1.14 materials might not work.
# You can also add the recipe name you created in recipes.yml and edit it here.

# Healing Amount
# This is where you define how many hearts each food can give to the player.
# Default values are the same default amount of hunger given to player when eating them.
# Note: Each full heart has 2 half hearts => apple: 4 -> 2 full hearts = 4 half hearts
# Note: Negative numbers do work.

# Consumable
# Basically it doesn't use the food instantly but consumes it normally but with the
# specified heal value and the effects.

# Potion Effects
# Effects given to players for each food.
