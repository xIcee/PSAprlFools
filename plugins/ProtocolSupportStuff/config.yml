#           ProtocolSupport features
# 
# = Enabling And Disabling Versions =
# versions:
#     MINECRAFT_1_13: true
#     ...
#     MINECRAFT_1_4_7: true
# 
# Toggling a version to "false" will disable that version on your server, this disabled the
# version at network level, so it will just reject the version when trying to connect/ping,
# like what happens when you try to connect to a outdated server version with your client.
# 
# Disabling at network level has its advantages, like disabling unused remaps, causing
# ProtocolSupport to use less memory!
# 
# = Block/Item Remapping =
# blocks/items:
# - from: Block that will be remapped (use this or "from-state")
#   to: New remap (use this or "to-state")
#   from-state: Block state that will be remapped (use this or "from")
#   to-state: New block state (use this or "to")
#   before/after/before-inclusive/after-inclusive/between: Minecraft Version(s)
# 
# If you don't like ProtocolSupport's default remaps, you can change them here!
# 
# However keep in mind that changing remaps may cause issues when breaking blocks if the time
# to break block is drastically different between the original block vs new block.
# 
# The from/to values uses the material enum names, check them here:
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# 
# The from-state/to-state uses block states, here's an example:
# minecraft:chest[facing=north,type=single,waterlogged=false]
# 
# You should use from-state/to-state if you need to remap specific states (example: specific rotations).
# 
# from-state/to-state only work with blocks, not items!
# 
# The version value uses the ProtocolVersion enum name, check them here:
# https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport/blob/master/src/protocolsupport/api/ProtocolVersion.java
# 
# Here is how you can specify what versions the new remap should affect:
#   before: Minecraft 1.12 (Every version (but not including) before 1.12)
#   after: Minecraft 1.8 (Every version (but not including) after 1.8)
#   before-including: Minecraft 1.12 (Every version (but including) before 1.12)
#   after-including: Minecraft 1.8 (Every version (but including) after 1.8)
#   between: "Minecraft 1.8, Minecraft 1.9" (Every version between 1.8 and 1.9)
# 
# = Hacks =
# Hacks can be used to fix features for older versions or to improve player experience on your server while using
# older versions.
# 
# They are named "hacks" because they are unstable!
# 
# sword-blocking               - Allows pre-1.9 clients to sword block and plays the "sword blocking" animation for
#                                pre-1.9 clients when a 1.9+ client shield blocks.
#                                Requires ProtocolLib and a auto shield block plugin (like OldCombatMechanics).
#                                While not required, using Paper will decrease the shield block delay to 0 ticks,
#                                having a better "old PvP" experience!
# strip-colors-from-long-texts - If a sign has more than 16 characters (including color codes), the colors will be
#                                stripped from the sign for pre-1.8 clients, this allows pre-1.8 clients to see the
#                                entirety of the sign contents, instead of only being able to see until the text
#                                cuts off. Example with a pre-1.8 client: "&a&lThis is too big!"
#                                False: "&a&lThis is too "
#                                True:  "This is too big!"
# 
# = Miscellaneous Stuff =
# add-to-lore            - Appends a text to the item lore if the item is remapped by ProtocolSupport
# newer-item-text-lore   - Text that will be appended to the item lore, if "add-to-lore" is enabled.
#                         {name} will be replaced by the item name.
# 						{id} will be replaced by the item ID ("minecraft:stone")
#                         {namespace} will be replaced by the item namespace ("minecraft")
#                         {key} will be replaced by the item key ("stone")
# translate-display-name - Changes the remapped item name to the "proper" item name
